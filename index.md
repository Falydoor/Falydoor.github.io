## Welcome

I am a seasoned Data Engineer and Technology Consultant with a vast experience in cloud computing, databases, and software development. With expertise in a range of tools and technologies including AWS, Kafka, Databricks, and Python, I have helped numerous clients optimize their data pipelines meeting and exceeding their goals.

My technical expertise are matched by my passion for sharing my knowledge with others. I have authored multiple blog posts covering and breaking down technical topics such as high-scaled streaming development with Kafka or Databricks Tips and Tricks. I have also presented in multiple conferences such as DevNexus, Connect.Tech and RVATech Data Summit.

I have a very good knowledge of [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) and I can provide expertise about it. I have been using JHipster for more than 5 years and also [contributed](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AFalydoor+is%3Aclosed) to the project.
