## Welcome

I am a Cloud Solution Architect and Technical Manager with 7+ years of experience and an open-source lover. Besides IT, I am a sports fan and traveler.

Currently living the life in NYC, I enjoy resolving daily challenges at my work while enjoying the New-York active life.

My skills are primarily focused on Data because I have good expertise in technologies like Kafka, EMR and Spark. I also have a big Java and Spring background since I have been using those technologies for more than five years. Cloud technologies are part of my main skills, especially AWS since I have two certifications.

I have a very good knowledge of [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) and I can provide expertise about it. I have been using JHipster for more than 5 years and [contributed](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3AFalydoor+is%3Aclosed) to the project.
